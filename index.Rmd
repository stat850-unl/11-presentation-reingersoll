# Links

isoslides created with Rmarkdown
  - Link: reingersoll.github.io/isoslides_intro.html

Beamer slides created with LaTex
  - Link: reingersoll.github.io/beamer_intro.pdf
  - Beamer did not generate an html document, so I was unsure how to host it and seemed only the PDF document worked to host
  
CV created with an Rmarkdown template
