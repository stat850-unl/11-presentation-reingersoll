#### Note of Issue:
Issue hosting this document at https://stat850-unl.github.io/12-presentation-<your-gh-username-here>/, correcting my personal location for the file. Instead I hosted it on my github.io repository. Also, I apologize for the mess of this repository from as I have used it for other classes.
